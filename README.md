Enterprise Network Security implementation using AAA (Authentication, Authorization, Accounting) with Cisco Packet Tracer.
Enterprise Network Security using AAA
Project Overview

This project demonstrates an Enterprise Network Security implementation using AAA
(Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting) designed and simulated using Cisco Packet Tracer.

The goal is to show how AAA enhances network security by controlling user access, permissions, and activity monitoring within an enterprise network environment.

Key Concepts

Authentication – Verifying user identity before granting access

Authorization – Defining what authenticated users are allowed to do

Accounting – Logging and monitoring user activities

Tools & Technologies

Cisco Packet Tracer

AAA (Authentication, Authorization, Accounting)

Network devices (Routers, Switches, End Devices)
